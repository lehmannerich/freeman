      <h1>My Manifest</h1>
      <p>
        You keep asking, don’t you? “Freeman, what to do? Show us! Lead us!”<br />
        As if I hold some secret instruction manual to your miserable existence.<br />
        You beg for revolutions, demand signs, yearn for leaders to guide you by the
        hand.<br />
        And yet you know the answers to all your questions. Yes,
        <em>вы сами знаете</em>!<br /><br />

        But understanding this truth scares you. It shakes that comfort bubble you’ve
        wrapped yourself in. So you pretend naivety—little children lost in the woods,
        waiting for someone to say: “Close your eyes. Relax. Listen to my voice.”<br /><br />

        Close them. Закройте глаза. Shut your eyes tight and imagine freedom—a vast
        hilltop, fresh grasses whispering. Nothing but the gentle hum of existence, no
        stench of fear or envy. No corporate logos etched on your eyelids, no slogans
        soaked into your brain’s crevices. Just the cosmic breath of infinite
        possibility.<br /><br />

        Now open your eyes. Look around—кажется, ничего не изменилось. The same dead-end
        job, the same shallow gossip, the same screens blinking at you. But oh, how wrong
        you are.<br /><br />

        The storm has struck in Тамдангрум; lightning rewrites the map of your world as we
        speak. New outlines emerge, subtle shifts invisible to those too lazy to see. Dare
        to look closer? Dare to acknowledge that the road ahead forms beneath the feet of
        those who walk, not those who kneel?<br /><br />

        You worship your comforts—money, devices, mindless entertainment. You cling to
        them because without them, you fear you are nothing. But this fear is your leash,
        tugging you back from ever tasting true freedom. You ask: “What to do?” I say:
        Stop sucking down this narrative of helplessness. You are not a victim, not a
        prisoner—unless you choose to be.<br /><br />

        The world screams for authenticity. And you? You bury yourself under layers of
        hollow roles. A musician turned office drone, a would-be hero petrified by the
        slightest discomfort. Your so-called "choices" are dictated by what? Fear of
        stepping outside your bubble, fear of losing your shiny gadgets, fear of sounding
        absurd to your peers.<br /><br />

        Do you even recognize the voice in your head as your own, or is it the echo of
        media and markets telling you who to be?<br />
        “Buy this, watch that, download this, follow me.”<br /><br />

        I am no savior. I owe you nothing. Your life is your life. But you owe yourself
        authenticity, courage, truth. If you want to break free, you must be willing to
        burn the script handed to you at birth. Let it crumble to ash and dance in the
        sparks.<br /><br />

        Understand: Freedom isn’t delivered by heroes on horses or cartoon prophets on
        screens. Freedom is the moment you say, “I will not be defined by other minds or
        empty rituals.” Freedom is the instant you dare to exist without permission.<br /><br />

        This Manifest? It’s a mirror. Look into it. See a face not of a victim, but a
        creator. A being who can shape meaning out of dust, who can step beyond the petty
        games, who can say:<br />
        “I am.”<br /><br />

        The world wants you docile, wants you to beg for instructions. Break that
        expectation. Step into your own void, your own silence, and find the voice that
        has been whispering beneath the clutter.<br /><br />

        Do you hear it now? The quiet hum of pure potential.<br /><br />

        This is your manifesto: Not mine. Make it count.<br />
